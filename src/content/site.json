				{
					"q": "What is it not?",
					"a": "Not therapy, not medical advice, not a crisis service, and not a replacement for a human teacher. It’s a practice-support environment."

					"a": "Light to medium practitioners who already meditate and want steadier continuity, clearer reflection, and optional shared sessions."
				},
				{
					"q": "How does the AI help during practice?",
					"a": "It can keep time, offer minimal prompts if you want them, and help you reflect after sits—focused on practical adjustments rather than grand claims."
				},
				{
					"q": "Is it really 24/7 live?",
					"a": "Yes. The mentor is available any time. Collective sessions run across the day and expand as the community grows."
				},
				{
					"q": "How do you handle privacy?",
					"a": "We aim for minimal data collection. Email subscribers can unsubscribe anytime. Any deeper privacy policy details can be linked once published."
				},
				{
					"q": "What does it cost?",
					"a": "Pricing is to be confirmed. The pilot is small so we can learn what support is genuinely useful and sustainable."
